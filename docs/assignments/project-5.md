# Project 5 Beta Release

## Design Revisions

- Changed post reactions - We decided to change the reactions on each post to emojis instead of the flower icon. We decided to do this because this kind of reaction is commonly used on other websites/social media so it will be easier to understand. Also we are now providing three different emoji options so users have some more freedom to express their opinions.
- Added Create Post and Invite User Buttons (on Careboard) - We forgot to add these buttons into our wireframes, but we need them for users to be able to interact correctly with the Careboard
- Removed Weight Trends - We decided to remove weight trends in the TodayView/symptom tracker due to time constraints on our project, as well as due to it being less of a relevant period metric than the other symptoms that we track. Weight gain or loss can fluctuate throughout a cycle, especially for someone with a menstrual disorder, and we also hope to remove pressure from users to maintain a certain weight, since some interviewees noted that weight was a trigger during their periods.
