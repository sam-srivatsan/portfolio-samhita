# 1. Broad application goals
**App Name:** GenSpeak
**Intended Audience:** Family members or friends across different generations, preferably with different first languages or a language barrier.
**Value:** Current social media apps are powerful, multifaceted ways to connect with so many people across the world. However, each app usually has a high concentration of a specific demographic: Facebook is more common among Gen X, Instagram among Millenials and Gen Z, and TikTok among Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Despite built-in translation features, people also cluster based on their language and nationality. GenSpeak is built for much communities that are both smaller and more generationally and linguistically diverse, such as immigrant families. It will focus on intuitive, universally usable app design and more photo, video, and audioclip capability than attemps at direct translations.
