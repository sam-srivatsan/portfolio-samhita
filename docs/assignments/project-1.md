# Project Impact Case

## Team Contract

Team Moira List: nans104@mit.edu

- **Expected level of achievement and effort for each team member (what grades do you expect to get? how much time do you plan to put in?):**

  We plan to spend at least 10 hours per week on this project. Each team member has stated that they want to achieve an A in this project. If a member can not perform their assigned task, they are obligated to inform the team, and proper backup measures will be followed.

- **Personal goals for each team member:**

  Sam: Keeping my concepts more modular so that synchronization and backend development is easier than last time!

  Nora: Maintaining a clean collaborative code base, building a great app

  Nisha: Developing better frontend and backend skills as well as UI skills.

  Ao: Build the frontend with a good visual design; Have robust backend design in the first place to avoid back-and-forth edits

- **Frequency, length and location of team meetings;**

  We will have a team meeting on Mondays from 2:30-4:00 pm
  We will meet with our TA (Dana) on Thursdays at 10 am

- **How quality of work will be maintained (reviewing each others’ code? team review meetings? pair programming?);**

  We will generally divide up our work into tasks and trust each team member to do their best to individually write quality code. On tasks that are confusing or require more collaboration we will do pair programming during our weekly team meeting. Additionally if there is confusion between how parts of the code work together, we will communicate in our group chat.

- **How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed;**

  Tasks will be assigned through the group chat, with deadlines documented in a shared spreadsheet or document. If any deadlines are missed, team members should promptly inform the group chat so adjustments can be made.

- **How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved.**

  Decisions will be made collaboratively, with any disagreements addressed during team meetings.

## Draft Impact Case

Half the population spends approximately ¼ of their teenage and adult life menstruating. It can take years for individuals to figure out what habits alleviate their symptoms and reduce the burden of pain and fatigue during a period or to have stigma-free conversations in and outside of their communities.

Our solution is to develop an app that has a comprehensive symptom and mood tracker so users can identify patterns in their data so they are better equipped to find solutions that work for them. Additionally we would like to include in our app a forum for users to create public posts (where they can choose to be anonymous) to discuss symptoms and solutions with each other, as well as a checklist to remind users to complete basic needs that may feel difficult for them when they are on their period.

We believe this is a good solution because although there are some existing apps for menstrual cycle tracking, these do not include a forum for people to discuss menstrual health or get peer support. Things we could measure to prove that our solution is effective include user-engagement on the forum, consistency in usage of the tracking feature, and results of user-satisfaction surveys within the app.

## Research Findings

- <a href="https://rockhealth.com/insights/to-track-or-not-to-track-how-digital-period-tracking-may-change-in-a-post-dobbs-world/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20who%20tracked%20their,period%20tracking%E2%80%9D%20throughout%20this%20piece.">Source 1: RockHealth Survey</a>

  RockHealth is a source that every year surveys nearly 8,000 adults about their digital health behaviors, which includes their use of digital trackers for menstruation. In the results of this survey, out of menstruating respondents aged 18-24, 42% said they used a digital means to track their periods, 33% did for aged 25-34, 26% did for aged 35-44, and 16% did for aged 45-55. This shows us that there is a common desire, especially among a younger demographic, for digital tools for menstrual cycle tracking. Additionally, out of the respondents who used a digital means to track their periods, 58% reported using a mobile app compared to 36% using a wearable or connective device and 26% using a digital journal. This shows us that there is a reason for our idea to be created as an app since it is the most used digital tool in this domain.

  This article (published recently in October 2024), starts by giving an introduction to how typical period-tracking apps work and later goes into some common problems that arise in these apps. It explains that one of these problems is the length of menstrual cycles can vary from individual to individual and from cycle to cycle, but many period-tracking apps will make predictions using a fixed “typical” length, meaning they may be inaccurate for many people. It also talks about how when an app’s predictions are wrong, users may “doubt their own body rather than the app’s accuracy” and feel stressed or worried. A final concern it talks about is how commonly in these apps, when good evidence-based information is available, it is often locked behind a paywall or very generic.

  - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmj6j3d8xjjo">Source 3: Study from BBC</a>

  This study examines the privacy policies and data safety labels of 20 of the most popular period-tracking apps. The study found “a host of poor data-management practices, including some apps not having a delete function, even for highly personal information such as menstrual cycles and miscarriages.” This shows us that in the design of our app, we need to be very clear and careful about the management of this sensitive user data. We should also try to find good ways to communicate how the data is being stored to the user. This study also includes some data results that I found very surprising. For instance, “35% of apps claimed not to share personal data with third parties but contradicted this in their privacy policies,” and “50% assured users that health data would not be shared with advertisers, but were ambiguous about other data collected”.

  - <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2022/07/removing-shame-and-stigma-menstruation">Source 4: Article from UN Human Rights</a>

  This article talks about the importance of destigmatizing conversations about menstrual health. It talks about menstruation as a human-rights issue and talks about how “because of taboo and gender stereotypes… many people experience menstruation with shame and without access to the resources needed to manage their menstrual health safely”. The article shows why it might be important for us to include a section on our app for people to be able to discuss symptoms and resources with each other, and also prompts us to think about things we might want to include in our app to make this feel like less of a taboo topic.

- **Modular Feature Design:** Maintain a modular app architecture to facilitate the addition of new features, such as fertility or hormonal health tracking, without affecting the overall design or functionality of other components. This ensures adaptability and scalability as user needs evolve.

<hr />

### Pervasiveness

**<u>Accounting for Culture</u>**

**Observation:**

- In many cultures, menstruation remains a taboo topic. The transparent and open nature of the forum feature may be perceived as offensive or make users feel uncomfortable.

**Response:**

- **Opt-In Forum Feature:** Make the forum an opt-in feature, allowing users to benefit from the tracking functionalities of the app without needing to engage with or view forum content if they prefer

- **Anonymous Posting Option:** Introduce an option to post anonymously within the forum, enabling users to participate in discussions and seek support without revealing their identity, thereby creating a more comfortable environment.

**<u>Widespread Use</u>**

**Observation:**

<u>Synergistic Benefits</u>

- **Enhanced Forum Engagement:** As more users join the app, increased activity on the forum leads to richer discussions and a broader range of perspectives. This can provide users with diverse and helpful information on various menstruation and health-related topics

- **Improved Predictive Accuracy:** Greater user data and feedback enable continuous refinement of the predictive model. This can improve cycle predictions, account for edge cases, and reduce the error rate by incorporating diverse factors that affect menstrual cycles.

- **Increased Awareness and Destigmatization:** A larger user base could contribute to increased awareness of women’s health issues, reducing stigma and encouraging more open conversations on the forum. This, in turn, fosters a more inclusive and supportive community.

<u>Potential Breakdowns</u>

- **Spread of Misinformation and Troll Activity:** With a larger user base, there is a higher risk of misinformation spreading or trolls disrupting discussions. This requires effective and scalable moderation strategies to ensure accurate and relevant discourse.

- **Increased Data Security Risks:** As app usage grows, it may become a more attractive target for malicious actors attempting to access sensitive user data. Ensuring robust data security measures becomes even more critical.

Transparent communication can prevent over-reliance and ensure informed decision-making.

<hr />

### Values

**<u>Choose Desired Values</u>**

**Observation:**

- **Accessibility:** Users should have access to a variety of symptom options and a straightforward, aesthetically pleasing user interface to make period tracking less intimidating, more consistent, and more enjoyable.

- **Community:** The app should provide a supportive community where users can ask for help and discuss menstrual health challenges, which can be especially valuable for individuals with menstrual disorders or those from communities where menstruation is stigmatized

- **Privacy:** Given that users will be sharing sensitive information with the tracker and in the forum, robust privacy measures are essential.

- **User Empowerment (Autonomy):** Users should feel empowered to understand and manage their health through accessible tools, educational content, and personalized features that support informed decision-making.

**Response:**

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app offers well-designed, easy-to-navigate pages with an intuitive interface to create a pleasant user experience. Consider providing users with options to choose from a range of color themes for personalization. Simplify logging processes by including daily tracker screens upon opening the app to encourage consistent use throughout their cycle.

- **Community:** Foster a supportive community by actively moderating forums to prevent bad actors and maintain a safe space. Enable anonymous posting to encourage open discussions and provide a comfortable environment for users to seek help and share experiences.

- **Privacy:** Prioritize secure data storage and enforce strong password requirements to minimize the risk of account hacking. Forum moderation will help prevent users from inadvertently sharing too much personally identifiable information, maintaining a high level of privacy and safety.

- **User Empowerment (Autonomy):** Offer tools and features that enable users to take control of their menstrual health, such as personalized insights, educational content, and symptom tracking. Empower users to make informed decisions and feel confident in managing their health.

**<u>Value Tensions</u>**

**Observation:**

- **Community vs. Privacy:** Promoting a sense of community through user discussions on forums supports open sharing and connection. However, this may compromise user privacy, as sharing detailed, personal information could make users identifiable.

- **Autonomy vs. Privacy:** The app aims to empower users with personalized knowledge and self-diagnosis capabilities through predictive tools and health insights. However, achieving this level of autonomy may require users to disclose a large amount of personal information, raising potential privacy risks.

**Response:**

- **Forum Privacy Reminders:** Before allowing users to post content, display a reminder about not sharing highly specific or sensitive personal information that could make them identifiable and pose a privacy risk.

- **Transparency in Data Use:** Clearly inform users about what data is being stored, who has access to it, and how long it will be retained. This transparency will empower users to make informed decisions about the data they choose to input, balancing their need for autonomy with the protection of their privacy.

## Revised Impact Case

Half the population spends approximately ¼ of their teenage and adult life menstruating! It can take years for individuals to figure out what habits alleviate their symptoms and reduce the burden of pain and fatigue during a period or to have stigma-free conversations in and outside of their communities.

Our solution is to develop an app that has a comprehensive period tracker that considers different symptoms and changes that come with a period. By tracking these symptoms, the app would empower users to be able to identify patterns in their data so they are better equipped to find solutions that work for them. In this tracker, users would also be able to opt-in to receive insights such as predictions, with reminders that the insights could be incorrect and they should consult a professional for any medical concerns. As a unique feature in our app, we would also like to include a forum for users to create public posts (where they can choose to be anonymous) to discuss symptoms and solutions with each other. This forum will be an opt-in feature since some users may not wish to engage with it (for cultural or other reasons). A final feature our app will include is a checklist to remind users to complete basic needs that may feel difficult for them when they are on their period.

We believe our solution is good because we aim at addressing the current gap for a safespace in which menstruating people could share their struggles and have discussions with their peers on how they could address such issues. Additionally, we aim at making this space to feel personally tailored for our users and their interests/struggles to better facilitate a healthier lifestyle for them.

We will measure our solution’s success through different periodical surveys that will be sent to our users on top of monitoring user engagement and growth in the platform. We will also aim to measure the consistency in which users interact with our app and the different features it will offer to determine what features work best for users and those that do not so that we may know areas of improvement or deprecation.
