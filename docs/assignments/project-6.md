# Beta App User Test Report

## Conduct User Tests

### General Guidelines:
- Follow tasks in order.
- Encourage participants to think aloud; prompt them if stuck.
- Do not explain the UI to them.
- Reserve the final 20 minutes for a debrief:
  - What worked?
  - What should be improved?
  - Where were they stuck?
  - What did they expect?

## User Test Reports

### Kat (Undergraduate Student)

**Overview:**
Kat's experience with the app was mostly positive, though she encountered several frustrations where functionality and UI clarity didn't meet her expectations. She appreciated the design but suggested some improvements.

**Key Struggles:**
1. **Logging Mood Selection**: Confusion over being able to select only one mood at a time. Expected to log multiple moods.
2. **Unclear Logging Labels**: Ambiguous terms like “none/light” for period flow caused hesitation. Suggested clearer labels for better understanding.
3. **Calendar Functionality**: Struggled with editing past/future entries and navigating back to the current day. Experienced text freezing.
4. **Post Creation**: Found the "+" button for creating posts non-intuitive. Suggested a more descriptive label.
5. **Careboard Interaction**: Difficulty locating buttons and identifying syncing issues with replies not appearing.

**Positive Aspects:**
Kat enjoyed the design and found account creation smooth. Overall, she described the app as “fantastic” but desired better functionality.

**Debrief Tension:**
Kat expected a seamless, intuitive app but was hindered by unclear labels and restricted functionality. While the design impressed her, usability issues created friction.

### Stella (30+, Reproductive Health Volunteer, PCOS Patient)

**Overview:**
Stella appreciated the app's design and community focus but noted areas where language and navigation didn’t align with their expectations. They valued features like anonymous posting for inclusivity.

**Key Struggles:**
1. **Gendered Language**: Terms like “sister circles” excluded nonbinary users. Suggested more inclusive language.
2. **Navigation Confusion**: Misinterpreted the "Today" button as clickable when it wasn’t. Suggested aligning functionality with expectations.
3. **Notifications System**: Missed updates due to an unclear notification system. Proposed default notifications for replies and messages.
4. **Cycle Graph and Timeframes**: Recommended adding a customizable graph to track trends.

**Positive Aspects:**
Stella enjoyed the anonymous posting feature and found the app visually appealing. They felt the app’s community focus was strong despite minor usability issues.

**Debrief Tension:**
The disconnect between the app’s intentions (support and inclusivity) and execution (gendered terms, unclear navigation) caused friction. Stella suggested minor changes for a more inclusive experience.

4. **Careboard Issues**: Experienced labeling and syncing errors. Suggested clearer descriptions for page purposes.

| Physical             | No Cycle Graph for tracking trends.                                                                          | Minor        | Add a graph with adjustable timeframes to visualize cycle patterns.                                                          |
| Physical             | Ambiguous logging labels (e.g., “none/light”) confused users.                                                | Moderate     | Use clearer and more descriptive labels for all logging sections.                                                            |
