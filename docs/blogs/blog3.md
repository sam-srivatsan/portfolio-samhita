# Blog 3: PlantIt - Nisha's Blog Critique

## Bouncing Beavers' PlantIt Pitch

I’m responding to Nisha’s blog post reviewing the Bouncing Beavers group’s PlantIt project pitch. I agree that it’s a super creative, cute concept! I thought the pitch was very engaging, including the (sardonic) jokes and appeal to the target audience.

### Target Audience

Speaking of audience...I agree with Nisha that the virtual garden may provide more instant gratification and value to students or a younger audience over full-time workers. This social-media style app may need some reframing in order to have a real effect on older users.

This tool could also scale to a younger audience: parents could use the virtual garden to incentivize children to keep up good habits or complete household chores.

Is there a way the Bouncing Beavers could add a collaborative garden where an entire office team, family, or friend group can grow plants together? This is not only fun but can be integrated with or posted on many social media platforms to bring people together for wider engagement, and promotes accountability and synergy in groups working together.


### Incentives

I think Nisha’s proposition of monetary or tangible rewards elevates the app from just a tracker to a motivator. However, I hesitate to encourage it, because it shift’s the app’s charm from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. PlantIt’s strength lies in its emotional appeal, so I’d argue for balancing tangible incentives with meaningful, creative rewards that align with the gardening theme.

If the Bouncing Beavers choose to stay within the realm of just tracking, having customizable gardens and plants (zen, tropical, space-themed, etc) can attract a wider audience.

For those that care about environmental impact, a partnership between PlantIt and real-world tree-planting/green initiatives could make the app more appealing. This combines real action (and credit, if a donation can be made in the user’s name!) with productivity, like the eco-friendly browser Ecosia.
