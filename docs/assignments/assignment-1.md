# SOCIAL MEDIA NEEDFINDING INTERVIEWS

Throughout the first half of 6.1040, I hope to design a social media app that bridges the language and generation barrier between family members or general community members. This idea is inspired by my relationship with my grandmother, Renu, who was also my first interviewee.

# INTERVIEW 1: RENU

(This interview was conducted in Tamil. Quotes are roughly translated into English) Interviewed my grandma, who lives in India, about her experiences using social media or messaging platforms, in line with the scope of the class project. I also asked her what it was like to maintain a relationship with her family who lives in the USA despite cultural and language differences. The two forms of social media she uses–in vastly different capacities–are WhatsApp group chats and Facebook. While she messages her children and grandchildren individually via WhatsApp, the groupchats have become a source of news and a sort of family calendar or announcement forum. “I’m terrible at remembering all of the birthdays in this family these days,” she told me. “But every time someone’s birthday comes around, one of your aunts or uncles will update the chat name–I still don’t know how to do that, can you show me how to do that?–and then I remember and I wish them a happy birthday.” Two things jumped out at me in this piece of our conversation; firstly, the multifaceted nature of WhatsApp depending on the number of people and context of the chat. It can be a conversation platform, a social accountability reminder tool, or even a calendar. Less obviously, her comment that she “still” hasn’t figured out how to change chat names after multiple attempts. While my grandma, who grew up in the 1950s, frequents and relies on this app, it is utterly unintuitive to her. If I ever aim to prototype a social media platform that bridges a generational gap, it has to be more simple and intuitive to even the least likely of its users.

We also talked about Facebook (the owner of WhatsApp, incidentally). Unlike many in my parents’ generation, grandma doesn’t use it to connect with family or friends. Instead, she uses it the way I use Instagram: to watch cute or relatable videos, or to “doomscroll.” She said that “I read about recipes, politics, pets–” and here, my grandpa jumped in with “she watches a LOT of videos about pets!” My grandma’s enthusiasm  was so valuable in this interview. I could tell what features appealed to her and what did not. She likes adorable puppies just as much as I, or even my thirteen-year-old cousin (who is already far more TikTok literate than I) does. I brought this up to share that I also relate, but that my generation prefers TikTok or Instagram. I asked her why she prefers Facebook. She replied that she appreciates that it has less bells and whistles. “They update it sometimes, but not that much really changes. It’s just one or two pages that I use.” I tried to show her how “for you pages” or reels work, and how they are different from statuses or stories or posts or profiles. “Too complicated,” she muttered. She shook her head expressively, and it was evident that trying to make sense of the different features tired her out. “I do not have Twitter or Instagram or any of that. They have so many different new pages. I have never used WhatsApp status.” She asked me if a status was where you posted if you were married or not. I tried to explain to her that there is a difference between status bubbles and relationship status tabs on some apps, and realized how overwhelming it must be for her to comprehend given how much older she was when social media came about. My grandma keeps scrolling and clicking through posts when she sees content that is familiar to her, that counteracts the unfamiliarity of her smartphone or social networks. She likes them if they remind her of her own dogs, or when they bring positive and secure emotions to her that make her feel the opposite of overwhelmed and uncomfortable.

I also asked her about how she best uses WhatsApp or Facebook to communicate with grandchildren who do not speak fluent Tamil. While I am fortunate enough to still speak and read semi-proficiently, not all of us do. “I text Tamil words in English characters, and then your brother responds to them in English. I know most of the words. I Google Translate the rest,” she explained. “It is easier to just send pictures.” I asked her what is easier about pictures. She said that she sometimes sends him a camera emoji and he responds with a photo update from his week, and she replies with a picture of what she’s been cooking or doing recently.

# INTERVIEW 2: MADINA

(This interview was mainly in English, but some parts are translated from my loose Russian comprehension)
 My second interviewee was Madina, my MISTI Global Teaching Labs host mom from Kazakhstan. Madina grew up speaking Russian and Kazakh. She learned English when her older sister studied to become an interpreter in her twenties. The objective of my interview with her was to hear about her experiences with social media, language barriers, and generational gaps. “My sister married an American man many years ago,” she said. “He did not want to learn any Russian language or Kazakh language. So we had to learn English. I did not use it much but I used it every day when you came to stay.” This corroborates with statistical evidence that being “forced” into an immersive language learning setting accelerates learning. I asked her if she felt that her rate of English improvement was comparable when I came to stay with her. She sighed, and I paused to see whether she was upset or happy or content or frustrated. “I felt really nervous to speak bad English to you,” she said hesitantly. “I wanted you to feel welcome and safe in a new country. I did not know whether it was better to speak less or speak more, but badly.” I was deeply touched, but also resonated with her worries. I feel a jarring lack of confidence whenever I speak to my grandparents in Tamil. I know I am not half as good as I once was, and I want them to feel comfortable and connected to me. Confidence plays a big role in either party’s willingness to reach out and start a conversation despite generational or linguistic differences. This inspires me to incorporate confidence or validation booster features in my app to help people feel more comfortable striking up a conversation, even with loved ones, especially if they speak different languages or do not speak to each other often. “Eventually I did get much more confident,” she said, smiling now. “My vocabulary is the same but I am more fluent and I felt more comfortable starting conversations with you.”
I also asked Madina what social media platforms she frequents. “I only use WhatsApp to chat with my friends and family,” she said. “I much prefer to send voice messages, FaceTime, or to talk in person.” Madina grew up in a village in western Kazakhstan in the 1970s, and did not have much access to computers until much later in her life, when she moved to Almaty, the biggest city in Kazakhstan. Even though she is far closer to my parents’ age than my grandparents’, she experiences a similar cultural and generational gap when it comes to social media. She does not use Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc. She said that it takes up a lot of time and mental energy. She did not feel that the apps were too complicated, so the generational gap was far less for her than my grandparents, because she was able to learn to use apps much quicker, but then decided she did not want to use them frequently. “I tried to learn from Duolingo, but it was too much of a game. To me, language practice is something between people, not a game,” she chuckled. I mentioned that a lot of younger folks prefer gamification. “My son started learning English at school but he learned so much more when he was playing video games online during COVID,” she said. “Many video game menus only had English options. And he played online with friends and practiced English daily.” She paused before joking that “of course, he learned the bad words first.” This also provided an interesting insight: gamification does not only come in the form of rewards for mastering vocabulary words. It also comes in the consumption of media such as video games, movies, TV shows, music, or books. Her son felt able to connect to friends across the world because he cared enough about the game to overcome the language barrier, and was also thrown into an immersive setting to practice his English.
I asked her if she ever struggled to maintain connections with people who did not speak Russian or Kazakh. She said that texting has been very helpful because she can think through her sentences in English or use an online translator before sending a message. She struggles a lot more in person, but that does yield far more practice and learning of an actual language, if that is her focus. “Texting is more useful in the short-term to connect and talk to people,” she said. She also uses a lot of emojis. GTL ended eight months ago, but I have remained in touch with Madina. Even when Google Translate, her clunky English, or my far clunkier Russian fails, she always texts a yellow heart emoji at the end of our conversations, and I know she is thinking about me.

# DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES IDEAS

* Super simple layout with minimal features: I envision an opportunity to reduce the generational gap and incentivize the use of my app by reducing the noise and information overload that a user receives. Both interviewees expressed feeling overwhelmed by many features or pages. I will only include one or two different main screens or tab options in my app instead of different ones for profiles, stories, statuses, reels, comments, etc. I will use distinct shapes and a neutral or pastel (not jarring) color palette to make users feel more at ease and in control of their experience. I suspect that a bold or sharply contrasting color palette might contribute to information overload, but I will research this further.

* The app will be limited to displaying only photos and videos contributed by 10 chosen family members and friends. These will be displayed in a horizontal scrolling fashion, such as a carousel or a “Tinder-swipe” design. This is familiar enough to clicking through Facebook posts and limits the options the user has to only swiping left or right. Reducing choices reduces information overload. Limiting videos to that of friends and family helps them receive content from loved ones and feel more connected, especially if they live far away. This also means there is a finite amount of content, which deters from the fear of social media addiction or overload. (Madina expressed worry that social media takes up too much time and energy) There will be no additional algorithm for doomscrolling, only posts and videos by a small, tight-knit group of loved ones.

* Emojis: Emojis are a powerful and almost-universally understood way to avoid the obstacles that come with words or characters in different languages, and to avoid the need for a third-party app within a small social media app. Instead of comments or likes, users can react to photos and videos with an emoji of their choice. This gives them more options for emojis but won’t overwhelm them the way comments might. My grandma shared that she uses a camera emoji to indicate that she hopes her grandkids will send her photos. Madina always uses a yellow heart emoji at the end of a conversation to indicate warmth and love, and to show that she wants to welcome me even when she feels she does not speak enough English to do so, or when she lacks the confidence to do so.

* Confidence stars: Users often lack confidence to reach out to family members online when they speak different languages or are of different generations or cultures. I am unsure exactly how I will address this, but I will add a way to send followers/friends/family members small confidence gifts or stars to encourage each other to reach out! This works well if everyone who uses the app is genuinely interested in connecting with the rest of their small network within the app.
