| **Task Title**                      | **Instruction For User**                                                                 | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Account Registration**            | “Your first task is to register with a new account.”                                      | Users need to be logged in to be able to access most of the features of the app. As well as setting up for the following tasks, this task will test if our login/register feature is discoverable and intuitive. |
| **Create a Group**                  | “Your next task will be to use the app’s logging feature. Log a mood, some symptoms, and a journal entry for today.” | Logging is a main feature of our app. By having a user create a logged entry for today, this task will test how easy/difficult it is for users to complete the multiple steps needed to log their data. |
| **Create a Post**                   | “Your next task is to add some more logged data for other days in the past. Create three more entries on different days, and then confirm that your cycle stats seem to align with the data you entered.” | This task will show us how easy/difficult it is for users to create a log if they already know the steps to do it. This is relevant for experienced users, and by having users create multiple logs, we ensure they have enough data for their “cycle stats.” |
| **Create an Event**                 | “Your next task is to create a post in Sister Circles. Once you’ve created a post, react to it with an emoji of your choice.” | This task is important to include because one of the main values of our app is community. It will test if the create button is discoverable and whether the interface for reacting to posts is intuitive. |
| **Create a Scrapbook (Image) Post** | “Your next task is to log out of your account and register with a second user.”            | This task is necessary to set up for the next task, where the user will need access to two different accounts. It will also test whether the user can easily find the logout button in the Settings page. |
| **Invite Another User to Group**   | “Your next task is to create a My Careboard post in your new account. Once you’ve created a post, invite your original account to your careboard. Log back into your original account and use the invite to visit this careboard.” | The Careboard feature promotes the community value of our app. This task will test if the invite management interface is intuitive and if the user can understand the state of their interaction with the Careboard. |
