# Project Phase 2: Divergent Design 

## Background :information_source:

<b>App Name:</b> VitalCycle
<br>

<b>Intended Audience: </b>Menstruating individuals seeking a comprehensive tool to track their periods and gain support for their menstrual health, as well as both menstruating and non-menstruating individuals who are interested in learning about women's health and menstrual well-being.
<br>

<b>Intended Value:</b> VitalCycle will focus on effective tracking/menstrual health journaling habits and community-building for longer-term awareness, destigmatization, and health. In existing period trackers, there exist features like being able to log which days your period/symptoms occur and being able to get predictive insights based on your logged data. However, there is a lack of community in these spaces, which could help connect users to find information, support, and resources that are relevant to them. In our app, as well as having tracking features, we will empower users to ask for help in a stigma-free conversation environment with peers, which can, in turn, help those with more severe irregularities be more aware of their need for medical help and seek it out.

## App Outline :clipboard:

1. **Concept:  Logging**

   **Purpose:** Allow users to log specific symptoms (cramps, headaches, fatigue, acne) via SymptomLog, journal mood with MoodLog, and track flow intensity with FlowLog. Users can either choose from a predefined list of symptoms or write their own. In addition, users can rate the severity of their pain for each symptom to monitor changes.


   **Operational Principle:**  The log entry interface is located on the app’s main page, making it quick and intuitive for users to log their daily symptoms. Each symptom, mood, or flow entry within the Logging concept captures a single day’s symptoms. To make a logged entry, users select from a predefined list or add custom symptoms. On each entry, they can also optionally log pain severity levels on a scale. Every entry is automatically timestamped, linking to a calendar view, where users can track and review their symptoms, flow, and mood changes over time. After creating an entry, users can click on this day in the calendar view to see what they logged.


2. **Concept: Checklisting**

   **Purpose:** Offer a checklist to remind users to complete essential tasks and build healthy habits throughout their cycle.


   **Operational Principle:** : When any symptom, mood, or flow intensity is logged,  a list of self-care actions (e.g., rest, hydration, meditation) will be dynamically generated that the user can complete and check off. The routines adapt based on logged symptoms and moods. Each user can have multiple checklists because previous checklists can be saved, stored, or popped back up throughout different parts of someone’s cycle!



3. **Concept: Posting**

   **Purpose:** Allow users to create posts that can be viewed by all other users. A forum contains a collection of public posts (standard concept). Each post has a text title and body where users can ask questions or share solutions that are working for them. Before sharing a post, users have the option to select whether or not they want to be anonymous. 


   **Operational Principle:** :  After pressing “create post” on the discussion forum page, the user will have blank “title” and “content” fields to populate as well as a checkbox asking if they would like to “post anonymously?” If they check it and then click “post,” the final post will have the creator marked as “Anonymous User.” Otherwise, the post displays the creator’s username.



4. **Concept: Replying[Item]**

   **Purpose:** Enable users to share their opinions and engage in conversations by writing replies to different items displayed in the app.


   **Operational Principle:** :  : Beneath specific items, users will find a “Reply” button. When clicked, a textbox appears for users to input their response. Once they submit their reply by clicking “Post Reply,” it will be displayed as an indented response below the original item, facilitating structured conversations and thoughtful interactions.


5. **Concept: Reacting[Item]**

      **Purpose:**  Allow users to show support and engagement by reacting to content created by other users through emojis, fostering a sense of community and connection.


      **Operational Principle:** :  Beneath relevant items, there is a “React” button. When clicked, users can choose from a set of four emojis to express their reaction. The selected emoji appears on the item, accompanied by a count indicating how many users have reacted similarly, providing a quick visual indicator of community sentiment and support. 

6. **Concept: Searching**

   **Purpose:** : Allow users to easily find content within the app by using keyword searches to locate posts, recorded moods, symptoms, and other items. 

   **Operational Principle:** : A search bar is prominently placed at the top of different views, enabling users to enter keywords. The search function retrieves matching elements, whether they are posts, logs, or other records, and presents them in a clickable list. This intuitive feature streamlines navigation and helps users quickly access desired content or revisit previous entries.

7. **Concept: Opting**

   **Purpose:** : Enable users to tailor their app experience by selecting which features they wish to access, such as discussion forums, mood tracking, self-care checklists, and more

   **Operational Principle:**  Within the user settings, there will be a section that displays a list of available app features, each accompanied by an opt-in/opt-out toggle. Users can activate or deactivate features based on their preferences. For instance, they can choose to disable the discussion forum while retaining tracking and self-care options, creating a personalized, streamlined app experience.

## Storyboards :movie_camera:

### Storyboard 01


<div class="scroll-container">
     <img src="./Project-SB01.jpg">
</div>

In this first storyboard, the user has a headache and mentions that she notices this happens often during her period. She decides to start tracking her symptoms on the app so she will be able to predict better when her symptoms will occur. She starts doing this by selecting her mood for today and typing in the symptoms she’s experiencing today. She continues logging entries into this tracker regularly. Later, she realizes she has an event on a day where she would predict from her logged entries that her symptoms will be starting again. She decides to move the event and later is happy that because she did this, she is feeling well on this day.

### Storyboard 02

<div class="scroll-container">
     <img src="./Project-SB02.jpg">
</div>


In this second storyboard, the user is experiencing symptoms from her period and is wondering if the app has any suggestions for her that will be helpful. She navigates to the forums page and sees many discussion posts by other users about different menstrual health topics. She uses the search bar at the top of the page to find posts about her symptoms and, within these, finds one post that seems relevant to her. She views the replies on this post and sees a user-suggested solution to her problem that she decides to try out. It works for her, and she feels much better.
