# Blog #2: Project Pitches

### What a cool idea!

I really loved the Phoenixes’ pitch for Outfinity! As someone who has way more clothes than I know what to do but only wears the same few T-shirts every week, I wish there was a way that I could see my own wardrobe through new eyes. I’m sure there are some cool pieces that others would style far better than I’ve ever thought to! Outfinity pitches just that: a new perspective on one’s own clothes.


### A few questions and comments...

1.  Is there any incentive for style/suggestion contributors to win a challenge? Is it purely out of their own interest to contribute? I think this kind of good-faith matching system is a great idea, but that there may be a benefit in leaning into the gamification with some sort of reward for being a frequent contributor or challenge winner. Perhaps that gives you more flexibility when creating your own challenges or seeking outfit help?

2. It sounds like users must first upload photos of all their clothes before they can request challenges. Could this prove to be a barrier for new users? As a busy student, I don’t have time to photograph my entire wardrobe, or even enough pieces of clothing to create many different outfits out of. Another question that “photographs of clothing” raises is: sometimes clothes look different on different people than they do on a hanger! Will there be many different views of each item like on Amazon/e-commerce sites? This is a tradeoff between better suggestions and more effort.

3. I think this app has so much potential! How would you scale it if it did really well? A few ideas I have are:

    3.1 Resale/Trade: Integrating crowdsourced e-commerce/resale like Depop! If users no longer want a piece of clothing, they can sell or trade it right on the platform.

    3.2 Further Gamification: Start a leaderboard of weekly style suggestion contributors! This could be by frequency or impressions (the number of people who upvote or like their suggestions, the number of times their suggestions get chosen as “winners”)

    3.3 Stylist Partnerships: Companies like Stitch Fix make a lot of profit off having personal stylists plan outfits or suggest and sell pieces to customers. While the value of Outfinity is its low-cost/free and crowdsourced nature (vs Stitch Fix actually sells clothes), an occasional stylist partnership or clothing giveaway or sale could keep a variety of users engaged!
