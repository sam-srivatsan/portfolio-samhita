# 1. Broad application goals
**App Name:** GenSpeak
**Intended Audience:** Family members or friends across different generations, preferably with different first languages or a language barrier.
**Value:** Current social media apps are powerful, multifaceted ways to connect with so many people across the world. However, each app usually has a high concentration of a specific demographic: Facebook is more common among Gen X, Instagram among Millenials and Gen Z, and TikTok among Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Despite built-in translation features, people also cluster based on their language and nationality. GenSpeak is built for much communities that are both smaller and more generationally and linguistically diverse, such as immigrant families. It will focus on intuitive, universally usable app design and more photo, video, and audioclip capability than attemps at direct translations.

# 3. Brainstorming feature ideas

**1. Story Swap**
Users from different generations can share personal stories, cultural experiences, or memories. Users can request or provide context to better understand the time period or culture behind the story.

**2. Cross-Generational Book Club**
Users from different generations recommend books, discuss literature, and share reading lists from different periods and cultures on a forum or digital book club.

**3. Language Mentor Match**
Match users who want to learn each other's native language. Grandchildren in other countries can learn about their native languages and traditions. Older generations can teach cultural context, and younger users can help with modern slang or terminology.

**4. Generational Challenges**
Participate in weekly challenges and collect a streak! These challenges encourage intergenerational collaboration and culture swap, like sharing music, movie/book recommendations, or trending content from each generation.

**5. Interactive Time Capsules**
Contribute photos, videos, and stories from different parts of your life and different decades to create interactive time capsules. Save them to show future generations and share with family members to learn more about heritage and history without a languae barrier.

**6. Language Learning Through Memes**
Share memes in different languages with translations and explanations. This makes language learning more humorous and accessible!

**7. Generational Jargon Translator**
Built-in tool to explain slang, idioms, or pop culture references. This could work like a glossary, where slang or generational terms are highlighted and defined when they pop up in others' posts or messages.

**8. Voice-to-Text Translation**
Voice messages are automatically translated into text for recipients in their native language. This is useful for older users who may prefer speaking over typing, while allowing younger generations to text. It may include emoji reactions.

**9. Generational “Wisdom Wall”**
Formatted like a Padlet ("sticky note posts") or Reddit (with upvoting capabilities) where older generations can share life advice, experiences, or lessons learned. Younger users can ask questions, and responses can be voted on and shared.

**10. Linguistic/Cultural Trivia**
Find partners and play a trivia game to see who knows the most about language, history, and culture from different generations and regions! Custom questions allow family and friends to learn more about each other.

**11. Skills Exchange**
Family members can share recipes or skills. Younger users can teach tech skills and older users can teach history, tradition, or classic skills (e.g., knitting, cooking).

**12. Multilingual Karaoke**
Formatted like Houseparty where users can join a karaoke video call or play a song and lyrics on their phone to sing with friends/family in-person. Users can choose from a song bank in different languages with accurate lyric translations.

**13. Hobby Matchmaking**
Formatted like Tinder, swipe and match with family members or users with similar hobbies or interests, such as gardening, technology, or sports. Connect via video or text to discuss shared passions or use a calendar feature to plan a hangout togethe. This focuses on activities instead of the pressure of speaking perfectly in each other's native languages.

**14. Timeline Collaboration**
Users in a family group can contribute to a collective timeline of global events or family events, adding personal memories or cultural context from their generation’s perspective.

**15. Cultural Celebration Calendar**
Description: A calendar that highlights holidays, traditions, and festivals from various cultures, religions, and generations. This can include the Lunar, Gregorian, Panchanga (Hindu) calendars and more! Users can share stories, photos, and videos explaining what those celebrations mean to them.


# 4. VSD Analysis
1. Criterion: Stakeholders, Prompt: Consider Children, Features: Skills Exchange, Language Mentor Match
    a. Observation: GenSpeak can positively impact a child's social and moral development. If a seven year old were playing with my app, they would benefit from building a connection, learning a skill, or learning a language from an older family member or disconnected due to generational or linguistic differences.
    b. Design response: Scoping the app to a small, curated group of family or friends keeps the app safer so that children don't engage with random or lesser known adults on the internet and share personal details.

2. Criterion: Time, Prompt: Sustained Friendships, Features: Cross-Generational Book Club
    a. Observation: The book club is a safe, comfortable setting for people to form deeper relationships with their loved ones by discussing literature, poetry, music, or books across cultures. Five years out, it might also encourage people to continue reading and thinking critically in an age of instant gratification and doomscrolling.
    b. Design: Integrate book club tab/page with a calendar functionality so that people can visually carve out meaningful downtime or reading time with their loved ones. Also include GoodReads inspired reading list/review page where app users or app group users (within a family/friend group) can collect suggestions and leave reviews!

3. Criterion: Pervasiveness, Prompt: Political Realities, Features: Story Swap, Generational Timeline (if events like wars or protests come up)
    a. Observation: Two political realities that my app could be used in, from personal example, could be places like the US, who have maintained independent democracy for many years, and Kazakhstan (one of my user interviews), which is currently undergoing a democratic and cultural revolution after the USSR dissolution. This means that users will have different political experiences and perspectives, which could cause friction on the app, especially because different generations even within one community may vary drastically in views.
    b. One option could be to ban or regulate political discourse on GenSpeak. Another could be to give users a platform to discuss it. This could be in the form of a strictly non-anonymous forum or messageboard to hold posters accountable, or a way to link multimedia such as news articles or clips. GenSpeak could also have an opt-out function for certain audiences, for example, parents who want to opt younger children out of politics and only use the family connection features of the app.

4. Criterion: Pervasiveness, Prompt: Crossing National Boundaries, Features: Linguistic/Cultural Trivia
    a. My user interviewees were from India and Kazakhstan. These countries could have totally different technology rules and social media etiquette than the US.
    b. My app might accidentally perpetuate misinformation or miscommunication. Hopefully, features like voice memos and photos will allow people to express their genuine tones instead of start flame wars based on misinterpreted text communication. However, the app also seeks to connect people from different countries and backgrounds! Thus, it will take advantage of these differences to form relationships based on embracing cultural differences and learning more about each other.

5. Criterion: Values, Prompt: Value Tensions, Features: Generational Time Capsule
    a. A time capsule feature might cause value tension between fostering community and data privacy. Users will add photos, images, recordings, and share personal information. This variety in media and the amount of time for which time capsules might be saved in the app or the cloud might make users feel unsafe too.
    b. Add an option for users to opt-in or out of sharing certain pieces of information, but also ensure that there is a robust way to store or erase the personal infomration and data after a certain time period. Always keep users in the loop.
